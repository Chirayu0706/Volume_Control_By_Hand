# Volume_Control_By_Hand
Using this model You can Control the Volume of your system just by you fingers!! The Only requirement is a Camera. You Can Increase Or Decrease the volume by increasing or decreasing the distace between you index finger and your Thumb. I used MediaPipe Hand Dectection and Tracking to get the positions of the Index Finger and Thumb. And Using PyCrow the volume was changed based on the distance between Index Finger and Thumb.
